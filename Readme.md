# PinkyPromise ü§ô

Cross chain loans using arbitrary promises on top of UMA

## Problem

Market makers and solvers (promisers) need immediate liquidity across a wide range of layer 1s and 2s which requires them to have directional exposure and is capital intensive.

Holders of tokens can often not earn a good yield and the commitment of staking is long term or not available for a lot of tokens.


## Solution

PinkyPromise allows market makers and solvers to enter commitments and loans using a single collateral on a single chain. Allowing them to access instant liquidity to fulfill intents and market make on any chain.
